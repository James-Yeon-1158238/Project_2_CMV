"""Implements simple MySQL database connectivity for a Flask web app.

This approach is based on the "Define and Access the Database" Flask
tutorial [1], adapted to use MySQL with connection pooling. It gives you an
easy way to request a database connection or cursor while processing a Flask
request, and gives you access to that connection from anywhere in your app
(including other functions or modules) until the request is complete.

Usage:
------
When initialising your Flask application, call `init_db` passing in your
`Flask` application object and database connection details:
```
>>> app = Flask(__name__)
>>> db.init_db(app, 'username', 'password', 'host', 'database')
```

Then, while handling a Flask request you can get a database connection
specific to that request by calling:
```
>>> db = db.get_db()
>>> # Your database code here...
```

If you need a new cursor, you can call:
```
>>> cursor = db.get_cursor()
>>> # Your database code here...
>>> cursor.close()
```

Alternatively, consider using a `with` block to ensure that the cursor is
automatically closed at the end of your query:
```
>>> with get_cursor() as cursor:
>>>     # Your query here...
```

Note that you don't have to close the database connection returned by
`get_db()` as it will be closed automatically at the end of the Flask request.
However, you should ensure that you close all cursors: this includes any
created by the `get_cursor()` function, and any you create manually using the
database connection.
